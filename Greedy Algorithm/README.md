###### **Knapsack Problem**

**Problem scenario**

A thief is robbing a store and can carry a maximal weight of W into his knapsack. 
There are n items available in the store.
N, number of items =7

W, total weight a thief can carry =16
Objects -- A   B   C   D   E   F   G

Profits -- 10  5   20  7   6   18  3

Weights -- 2   3   5   7   1   5   1


Note: The items should be selected in such a way that the thief will carry those items for which he 
will gain maximum profit. Hence, the objective of the thief is to maximize the profit. In this problem,
