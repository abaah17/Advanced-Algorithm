"# Advanced-Algorithm" 

 The repo contains exercises that enables me to understand and practice, as a software engineer, the implications 
 of computational complexity and their role in efficiency of applications/ solutions to problems 
 
 
 **Course Objectives:**
 
 There are exercises that are going to ensure the following objectives are achieved 
 
 1. Outline different algorithmic approaches to solve computing problems
  
 2. Selecting and apply an algorithm fitting for a specific scenario 
 
 3. Map complex real-world problems to algorithmic solutions
